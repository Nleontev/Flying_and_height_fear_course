#Testing
While developing this project, I very often changed the look of the layout already at the coding stage, because it looked worse to me on the screen than on the layout, and I brought it to the ideal in my opinion. In my view, everything should work as it works now, because that's how it was intended by me, I ran tests during development and fixed all the errors that appeared on the way, I wanted to introduce the use of grids, but I didn’t master them enough.I have been testing how my course works on different devices long and hard and found bugs many times, especially on the smallest size, even after the submission, because there it is easiest not to notice the error. Now it works great on all screen sizes.I met an interesting case. When I was working on the strategy section, I initially created the methods themselves in two divs, but then I realized that this would interfere with me when I did the responsiveness and I thought it would take a lot of time to rework, but with the help of flex I fixed it much faster than I expected.
